## Bonus  (10 points) DL 20/3 (about 2 weeks from  now) (ALREADY UNDERSTAND)

The bonus exercise for Lecture-02 and Lecture-03 is the same. So I decided to do the bonus in Lecture-03 Bonus folder only.

The **bonus** is worth 10 points. it is meant as a refresher for HTML/CSS. 

Visit [Internetingishard.com](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/) and work out the exercises in the following chapters:
- The Box Model
- CSS Selectors
- Floats 
- Flexbox
- Semantic HTML
